# Twitter Clone - Marvel Edition!

## ABOUT

This project is a fun twitter clone with a Marvel Universe twist. Instead of having to sign up, you choose an avatar that is pre set from the Marvel Universe and tweet "as that character". Everything happens in 'realtime', utilizing Realtime Firestore Database, so that when you tweet, your posts will automatically appear on the timeline.

Just a twitter clone, so only Home page is functional, with an added live twitter feed on the Widgets area of Marvel Entertainment.

This project was to familiarize more so with React and front-end UI rather than authentication and sign up that I have done on other projects.
