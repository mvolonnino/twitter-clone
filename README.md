# Twitter Clone - Marvel Edition!

## About

This project is a fun twitter clone with a Marvel Universe twist. Instead of having to sign up, you choose an avatar that is pre set from the Marvel Universe and tweet "as that character". Everything happens in 'realtime' so that when you tweet, your posts will automatically appear on the timeline!

Just a twitter clone, so only Home page is functional, with an added live twitter feed on the Widgets area of Marvel Entertainment.

This project was to familiarize more so with React and front-end UI more so authentication that I have done in other projects.
